												<h3>Manufacturing Process</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The manufacturing process for the Hand Coffee Grinder involves two primary methods: Gravity Die Casting and CNC Machining. Gravity Die Casting utilizes reusable metal molds to produce solid, high-quality metal components. The process involves the use of a mold composed of high-strength metal, cores for creating internal cavities, ejector pins for removing the casting, and cooling channels for proper solidification. Specialized equipment includes Gravity Die Casting Machines, Furnaces for melting metal alloys, and preheating equipment for mold preparation. CNC Machining, on the other hand, employs computer-controlled machines to intricately shape and remove material from a workpiece. CNC Milling Machines, Lathes, and Grinding Machines are utilized for various machining operations with exceptional precision. Both processes undergo setup and preparation, tool selection, machining operations, and quality control measures to ensure the final product meets required specifications. Sustainability considerations include optimizing energy consumption, minimizing material waste, and implementing recycling and waste management practices to align with green manufacturing principles. Through these manufacturing processes, AMA ensures the production of premium Hand Coffee Grinders while striving for environmental sustainability and efficiency.</p>

												<h3>Final Design</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The final design for the Hand Coffee Grinder project integrates the precision of CNC machining with the durability of gravity die casting. Each component is meticulously crafted using CNC milling machines to achieve intricate shapes and precise dimensions, ensuring optimal functionality and aesthetic appeal. The gravity die casting process is employed to produce solid metal parts with high strength and consistency. By combining these manufacturing methods, the Hand Coffee Grinder not only exemplifies superior craftsmanship but also embodies durability and reliability. Additionally, the design allows for easy assembly and maintenance, enhancing user experience and longevity. Overall, the final design showcases the perfect balance of advanced machining techniques and traditional casting methods, resulting in a high-quality product that meets the demands of both performance and aesthetics.</p>
