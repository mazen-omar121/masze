										<h2>Project Description</h2>
									</header>
									<p>In response to the burgeoning field of digital manufacturing and its transformative impact on industrial processes, this project aims to innovate within the realm of computer peripherals, specifically focusing on custom mechanical keyboards. With digital manufacturing enabling intricate designs and precise assembly, the project seeks to address a niche yet crucial aspect of keyboard functionality: the acoustic profile of key presses. Traditional keyboards often sacrifice aesthetic complexity for mass production efficiency, but with the advent of digital manufacturing, there's an opportunity to create custom, visually striking keycaps that also enhance the typing experience. Leveraging the principles of magnetic levitation, commonly used in technologies like Bluetooth speakers, the project proposes integrating magnets into both the keycaps and keyboard assembly to dampen key press intensity and provide a quieter, more customizable typing experience. Through detailed analysis and experimentation, the project aims to develop manufacturing processes to seamlessly integrate magnets into the keyboard design, offering users a novel combination of aesthetics and functionality in their computing peripherals.</p>
