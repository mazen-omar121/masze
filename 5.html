										<h2>Project Description</h2>
									</header>
									<p>This project entails the design and analysis of a ball launcher propelled by a single motor, featuring two wheels rotating in opposing directions to launch the ball forward. Employing a speed conversion box with spur gears, the design aims to achieve precise rotation speeds for both wheels. Additionally, an alternative V-Belt system is explored for speed conversion. The report delves into detailed insights regarding product design, motor selection, speed conversion mechanisms, and the alternative belt-driven system. The primary challenge lies in balancing motor performance with launcher efficiency to ensure smooth operation. Functional requirements include propelling a standard-sized ball accurately and consistently, synchronizing wheel rotation, accommodating a single motor, and providing user-friendly operation. Materials and components are meticulously selected for durability and optimal performance. The design of the speed conversion box utilizing spur gears is outlined, considering torque distribution and thrust load considerations.</p>

												<h3>Design Requirements</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The design requirements for the ball launcher project encompass a meticulous selection of materials, components, and mechanisms to ensure optimal performance and reliability. The primary objective is to propel a standard-sized ball with precision and consistency using a single motor driving two launcher wheels in opposite directions. Functional requirements include propelling the ball with sufficient force, synchronizing wheel rotation, accommodating a user-friendly interface, and maintaining a consistent launch trajectory. The design incorporates a speed conversion box utilizing spur gears for precise rotation speed control, with an alternative V-Belt system also explored. Detailed analysis and testing of gears, shafts, and bearings ensure durability and efficiency under varying loads and rotational speeds. The final gear system, comprising seven gears with specific material properties and pitch characteristics, forms a reliable reduction system to achieve the desired operational performance. Similarly, the selection of bearings is meticulously evaluated based on reliability, angular ball bearing characteristics, and lifespan considerations to ensure smooth operation and longevity of the ball launcher.</p>
