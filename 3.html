										<h2>Project Description</h2>
									</header>
									<p>In the construction industry's age of automation and power tools, the advent of the portable electric cement mixer has significantly enhanced efficiency by delegating the laborious task of cement mixing and pouring to a portable, electrically powered machine. This innovation ensures consistent cement mix quality and reduces lead times. However, designing a reliable and safe machine capable of sustained use in rugged conditions is a complex endeavor. Understanding the mechanics behind an electric cement mixer reveals the necessity for a dependable power source, efficient power conversion mechanisms, and robust construction to withstand rough job site conditions. This case study delves into analyzing various parameters essential for ensuring the safety and functionality of such mixers, employing systematic methodology and engineering evidence for critical assessment. The problem statement focuses on analyzing a mixing drum tasked with blending a total mass of 150 kg of cement mixture, requiring specific inclinations and movements for optimal operation.</p>

												<h3>Design Requirements</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The design requirements for the project encompass several key elements to ensure the functionality and efficiency of the system. Firstly, the drum must rotate within a specified range of 15 to 20 rpm in a clockwise direction, with dimensions not exceeding 1.0 m in diameter and depth. The system's power source is a 240V AC motor, requiring appropriate torque and power output for effective operation. Integration of gear reducers and belts with pulleys is essential to maintain the required rotational speed. Structural support is provided by frames, which can be either welded or bolted together. Meeting these specifications ensures the system's basic functionality. However, the project must also demonstrate logical and engineering soundness while being practically applicable. Therefore, the design process will employ methodologies used in modern power transmission systems to ensure a robust and effective solution.</p>

												<h3>Basis of Safe Design and Selection</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Safety is paramount in the design of mechanical components for this project, encompassing bolts, motors, belts, and weld selection for both the system and its subsystems. The methodology outlined in later sections of the report is rooted in ensuring safe design practices. Beginning with the output stage, where the barrel of the mixer must rotate within a specified speed range, the selection process is reverse-engineered to prioritize safety. Starting with the required power and torque, derived from the rotational speed and mass of the cement, assumptions are made about the barrel's material and total mass. By calculating parameters such as mass moment of inertia, safety considerations are integrated into the design process from its inception, laying the foundation for a robust and secure system.</p>

												<h3>Final Design</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The final design of this project and case study is shaped by a defined scope, which sets out the essential assumptions and limitations for analysis. It encompasses detailed numerical analyses focusing on stress and force calculations, aiming to establish the practical and theoretical feasibility of the system beyond reasonable doubt. However, the scope also serves as a logical limitation due to the depth of analyses required. Moving forward, the scope includes considerations such as power and torque requirements for motor selections, with references from TECHTOP Australia Motor’s Catalogue and V-Belt Manufacturer- MITSUBOSHI. Material strengths, hardness, bearing sizes, and numbers are sourced from "Fundamentals of Machine Component Design, Sixth Edition" by Juvinall. Additionally, a design factor of (2.5) is assumed to ensure all calculations adhere to acceptable safety limits. These parameters form the foundation of the final design, ensuring its robustness and adherence to safety standards.</p>
