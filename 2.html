										<h2>Project Description</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Introducing the groundbreaking Palm Harvesting Vehicle (PHV), a revolutionary solution designed to redefine the efficiency and productivity of palm oil fruit harvesting in Malaysia's vital palm oil industry. Developed in response to the pressing need for innovation in this sector, the PHV aims to streamline the labor-intensive process of harvesting, cutting, collecting, and transporting palm fruits, ultimately enhancing the productivity of plantation workers while optimizing resource utilization.</p>

												<h3>Client Description</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The objective of this study is to develop an autonomous device that addresses key challenges in roadside drain maintenance. This device will effectively clear blockages and collect litter, ensuring the cleanliness and functionality of drains without relying on traditional power sources. It must be self-sufficient in power generation, easy to maintain, and compliant with Malaysian road design standards to prevent further flooding. Based on customer feedback, the primary needs identified include reducing the effort and time required for drain cleaning, minimizing dependence on manual labor, and mitigating the high cost and declining efficiency associated with current methods. These needs form the basis of the product design specification, guiding the development of criteria to meet customer expectations effectively.</p>

												<h3>Concept evaluation</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Concept selection is a pivotal stage in product development, requiring meticulous consideration and analysis. Initially, product functions were identified, and a morphological chart was crafted to explore various conceptual avenues. This broadened the scope of possibilities while highlighting feasible solutions. Subsequently, three concepts per team member were generated, incorporating feedback and refining designs to align with project requirements. The screening process involved thorough evaluation against predefined criteria, considering aspects like ease of use, maintenance, and environmental impact. Concepts C and F emerged as frontrunners, scoring highest across key categories. Further refinement through concept scoring, focusing on factors like cleaning efficacy and maintenance, ultimately led to the selection of Concept C as the preferred choice for advancing to subsequent development stages.</p>

												<h3>Final Design</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The final design of the autonomous drainage cleaning system seamlessly integrates mechanical functionality with electronic and algorithmic foundations. Inspired by household cleaning robots like "Roombas," the system's core objective is to autonomously clear rubbish and clean drainage, akin to its household counterparts' floor cleaning capabilities. Leveraging open-source libraries such as OpenCV and numpy, the system processes visual data from cameras and sensors, employing image processing techniques like Gaussian Blur and Hough Line Transform to generate navigation guidelines. These guidelines, coupled with machine learning models like YOLO, enable the system to detect roadside drains accurately. By analyzing vast amounts of data and forming patterns, YOLO facilitates the recognition of drains amidst complex surroundings, ensuring effective drainage cleaning operations. Through the seamless integration of mechanical, electronic, and algorithmic components, the final design embodies efficiency and precision in addressing drainage maintenance challenges.</p>
